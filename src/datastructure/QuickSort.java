/**
 * This comes with O(n log n base 2) complexity -> Logarithmic complexity but in worst case it perform O(n2)
 It's an UnStable sort
 This sort os based on divide and conquer concepts. It also heavily based on recursion mechanism. We can use iterative mechanism as well.
 This sort is based on choosing pivot (A random element) and putting lesser value at left side and higher value at right side.
 There are some optimisations added during the data dependency .
 This Sort basically overcome the burden of element value comparison for insertion, shell or bubble sort.
 This sort not use the extra space like Merge sort and provide an easy solution

 Limitations-:
 As slow as bubble sort in the worst case!
 Iterative implementation isnâ€™t easy
 There are faster algorithms for some sets of data types

    /*
    Implementation logic to perform Quick sort
        1. Choose indices 0 as pivot element and perform value comparison to find the right index for pivot
        2. Put the pivot at right place after performing the partitioning algo. Now we have two set Left and right divided by pivot
        3. Not perform same operation recursively. Here each element will get chance to be a pivot once.
        4. At the end we will receive the sorted array

       Note -> Partitioning will done using value shifting and holding current value from both left and right side.
               We have to make sure that left and right indices should not cross each other.
